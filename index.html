          About Me
        </h2>
        <a name="about">
          <p class="about-content">
            I'm new to the web development world and I'm excited to dive into this industry, learn as much as I can, and grow my skill set.
            I'm 26 years old and since graduating college I've been working as a Web Infrastructure Specialist at a banking software company in Connecticut. 
            I have a degree in Statistics from the Univsersity of Connecticut and I have a passion for solving problems. Research and constant
            learning are extremely important to me. If there were a certification for internet searching your way out of a problem, I'd have one.
            I'm a big proponent of online privacy and open source software.
